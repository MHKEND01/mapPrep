<p> One mistake people can make when creating data visualizations as maps is using a misleading projection. As the Earth is spherical, no two-dimensional projection can accurately map the planet. There will inevitably be distortion in either shape, area, angles, distance, and direction. You don’t want to use a certain map projection if it may distort the message of your visualization. At the very least, readers should be aware of these distortions. For instance, in grade school I unthinkingly assumed that Greenland was a massive continent because I had seen projections like <a href="https://www.onestopmap.com/product/map-world-political-high-detail-mercator-europe-africa-centered-633/">these</a> in school textbooks. Mercator projections preserve the shapes of continents, but grossly distort relative sizes. In reality, Greenland is about one-third the size of Australia. I failed to realize that for a long time because textbook writers and teachers failed to highlight the distortions of the Mercator projection. </p>
<p>Another mistake which could be made when creating data visualizations as maps is to incorrectly conflate a map’s area with some other variable, such as population. For instance, in <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/11/15/donald-trump-won-7-5-million-popular-vote-landslide-mainstream-america/this</a> map, readers see that the majority of the counties are colored red and may incorrectly assume Donald Trump handedly won the popular vote. However, many of the red counties have a very low population, so it is easy to be misled. The size of a county has nothing to do with its population or number of voters, but that information is not immediately apparent from a map. In reality, Donald Trump did not win the popular vote. </p>
